# cipher-decipher

([Data structures project 2022](https://tiralabra.github.io/2022_p4/index) repository)

A simple-substitution cipher decryption program. Can be started from an IDE or (theoretically, if DISPLAY variable is set correctly) from the command line with command `gradle run`.

For testing the program, use one of the crypted texts in [sample texts](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/cipher-decipher/sample_texts.md) as input, for example - you can try your own texts, too. The long dictionary is in use now so results may be bizarre for very short test texts (like one sentence or a few words).

There are currently two dictionaries for the program in this repo. The first, currently in use, [dictionary_long](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/cipher-decipher/dictionary_long.txt) was copied from here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, but they state that the original was from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable. The second, shorter [dictionary](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/cipher-decipher/dictionary.txt) was copied from here: https://github.com/filiph/english_words/blob/master/data/word-freq-top5000.csv.
