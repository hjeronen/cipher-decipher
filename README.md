# cipher-decipher

([Data structures project 2022](https://tiralabra.github.io/2022_p4/index) repository)

A simple-substitution cipher decryption program. Can be started from an IDE or (theoretically, if DISPLAY variable is set correctly) from the command line with command `gradle run`.

For testing the program, use one of the crypted texts in [sample texts](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/sample_texts.md) as input, for example - you can try your own texts, too. The algorithm stops at the first possible solution, so the results may not be what was expected for very short test texts (like one sentence or a few words).

The english word list that is used in the program, in file [dictionary](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/cipher-decipher/src/main/resources/dictionary.txt), was copied from here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, but they state that the original was from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable.
