# cipher-decipher

([Data structures project 2022](https://tiralabra.github.io/2022_p4/index) repository)

A simple-substitution cipher decryption program.

There are currently two dictionaries for the program in this repo. The first, [dictionary_old](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/cipher-decipher/dictionary_old.txt) was copied from here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, but they state that the original was from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable. The second, currently in use [dictionary](https://github.com/hjeronen/cipher-decipher/blob/main/cipher-decipher/dictionary.txt) was copied from here: https://github.com/filiph/english_words/blob/master/data/word-freq-top5000.csv, but I added some more words that were missing.
